# Username remember-er
This is basically the username remember-er you always wanted for a website. Made using Python and SQLite3. Almost finished! Any help would be greatly appreciated.
<br></br>
How to use:
<br></br>
All you have to do is modify 'main.py' to add or display your username, like so. Func is already imported, so don't worry about that.
<br></br>
<strong>func.putin(username, website)</strong>, the username and website being changed with the actual username and website. This is for adding your username and website to the database.
<br></br>
If you want to display a username, run the program. Enter your website as prompted, and follow the other instructions.
